# Configuration Management Kata
Install/configure the CM tool of your choice.

Automate the provisioning of a 3-tier web application stack (data layer, application layer, presentation layer). An example stack might be, but is in no way limited to, redis/passenger/nginx.

Automate the deployment of a simple 'ping' page that establishes that each of the 3 layers in the stack are available.

Provide us with access to your repository and identify a few issues that represent the next features to be delivered in your application. Don't be surprised if someone commits a change that addresses one of the issues. Your project should be complete as delivered, but every project has a 'next step' and we'd like to know what you think your next steps are.

###  Components of this exercise:
* A Github or Bitbucket repository with your solution.
  - Make incremental commits so that the reviewer can follow your development process.
* A README file with instructions on how to setup your solution on the reviewâ€™s computer.
  - At the end of the README provide your view of the next steps for this solution.
